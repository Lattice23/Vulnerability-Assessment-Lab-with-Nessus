Vulnerability management plays a crucial role in cybersecurity. It helps organizations identify, assess, and mitigate vulnerabilities in their systems and networks.

It allows organizations to conduct comprehensive vulnerability assessments by scanning networks, systems, and applications for known vulnerabilities while providing detailed reports.
