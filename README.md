## Introduction

Vulnerability management plays a crucial role in cybersecurity. It helps organizations identify, assess, and mitigate vulnerabilities in their systems and networks. I will be demonstrating how to do that with Nessus. Nessus is an open-source widely used vulnerability scanning tool that is highly effective. It allows organizations to conduct comprehensive vulnerability assessments by scanning networks, systems, and applications for known vulnerabilities while providing detailed reports.

## Objective

By following this guide, others learning cybersecurity like myself will be able to set up their own vulnerability management lab using Nessus, gaining valuable experience in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in a controlled environment. This hands-on practice will enhance their understanding of cybersecurity and equip them with the skills needed to secure systems and networks effectively.

# Requirements 

- VMware Workstation Player [link](https://www.vmware.com/content/vmware/vmware-published-sites/us/products/workstation-player.html.html)
- 1 x Windows 10 ISO file [Link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)
- Nessus Essentials [Link](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials)

# Nessus setup
1. Fill out the [registration](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials) form to acquire an activation code in your email.
2. Go to the email and click on download Nessus
3. After the installation, a web interface will appear on your browser.
4. Connect via SSL then click advanced and continue after getting a warning from the browser.
5.  Select Nessus Essentials
6.  Press skip and proceed to enter your activation code.
7.  Create a User account and login
# Troubleshooting 
Lost the Nessus web URL?
(The web interface runs on your loopback address on port 8834. Using this in the search bar should fix the issue “https://127.0.0.1:8834”.)

# VMware setup
1. Go to player and select file to create a new virtual machine.
2. Select the ISO file for the installer disc image.
3. In VM Settings, set the network to NAT or Bridged. (change CPU cores and memory depending on how fast you want the VM to be)
4. Power on the virtual machine after creation.
5. Start the virtual machine and quickly press any key to enter setup mode.
6. Select “I don’t have a product key” and select Windows 10 Home.
7. Choose “Custom install” and select the unallocated space for installation.
8. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation
# Troubleshooting connectivity
After setting up your VM you will need to open up the command prompt to check if there is any connectivity by using the command “ipconfig”. After getting the IP of the VM go ahead and ping it from your host machine. If you receive a message saying “Request Timed out” go into your VM’s Windows Defender Firewall > Windows Defender Firewall Properties > Disable “Firewall state” on every profile.

# Nessus scanning
Once you start Nessus you will want to select a new scan. just starting out all we need is a basic network scan. You can also check out all the other types of scans too.

Choose a name for your scan and enter the IP address of the VM as a target. After saving, launch your scan and Nessus will start adding any info or vulnerabilities it finds on the VM.

# Credentialed scans
We can also run a credentialed scan on the VM. A credentialed scan can quickly determine which systems are out of date on patch installation compared to a non-credentialed scan like we just did. This is especially important when a new vulnerability is made public and executive management wants a quick answer regarding the impact to the organization.
