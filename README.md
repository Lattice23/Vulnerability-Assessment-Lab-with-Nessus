## Introduction

Vulnerability management plays a crucial role in cybersecurity. It helps organizations identify, assess, and mitigate vulnerabilities in their systems and networks. I will be demonstrating how to do that with Nessus. Nessus is an open-source widely used vulnerability scanning tool that is highly effective. It allows organizations to conduct comprehensive vulnerability assessments by scanning networks, systems, and applications for known vulnerabilities while providing detailed reports.

## Objective

By following this guide, others learning cybersecurity like myself will be able to set up their own vulnerability management lab using Nessus, gaining valuable experience in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in a controlled environment. This hands-on practice will enhance their understanding of cybersecurity and equip them with the skills needed to secure systems and networks effectively.
